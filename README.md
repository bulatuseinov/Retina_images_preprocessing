# Retinal images preprocessing and extracting vessels with DL or OpenCV methods
## This code were used for processing images of human retina from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) 

### How to Use?:
1. ```import utils_img.py and process.py```.
2. Use high-res images > ```256x256```.
3. You need to read image by random lib, so you need the image to be in ```BxGxR``` format.
4. With this code u can feel free to use ```CLAHE``` or ```Ben's``` preprocessing.
5. Moreover there are two smart croppers inside.
